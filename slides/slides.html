# .center[What is .secondary-color[GraphQL?]]
<hr>
- GraphQL is an API for your data
- GraphQL is like SQL for all your data services
- GraphQL provides a standards-based query language to request the data which is needed
- The data structure is not limited to a "row" or a single "resource", but is a map of data spanning many nodes and collections of nodes

---
template: content

# .center[What is .secondary-color[GraphQL?]]
<hr>
- GraphQL is superior to REST services
 - Request only the needed data
 - Combine multiple resources into a single request
 - Mutations are not tied to the HTTP verb system
 - Queries follow a standard not conventions
 - Query syntax is easy to use

---
template: content
 
# .center[What is .secondary-color[GraphQL?]]
<hr>
- GraphQL can be used with REST services
 - Existing data services, including REST services, can be wrapped in GraphQL
 - Wrapping existing data services in GraphQL allows GraphQL to be used today without rewriting existing systems
 - GraphQL can be adopted as needed
 
---
template: content
  
# .center[What is .secondary-color[GraphQL?]]
<hr>
- GraphQL supports three kinds queries
  - Retrieving Data (think of SQL select)
  - Mutating Data (think of a more flexible SQL insert, update, delete)
  - Introspection queries to retrieve the schema of the GraphQL types

---

# .center[What is .secondary-color[GraphQL?]]
<hr>
- GraphQL supports a sophisticated type system
 - GraphQL is a standard which can be implemented in any programming language such as JavaScript, Java, .NET, Python, etcâ€¦
 - Types are not tied to the implementation language's types
 - GraphQL support primitives, enums, object types
 - Also, GraphQL supports interfaces and union types


---

# .center[What is .secondary-color[GraphQL?]]
<hr>
- GraphQL and Web Applications
 - GraphQL returns query results in a JSON format
 - Calls to GraphQL can be made with the XHR object or the newer Fetch API
 - All calls are POST requests
 - Several programming clients for GraphQL exist, two popular ones are Apollo and Relay

---
template: content

# .center[What is .secondary-color[Apollo?]]
<hr>
- Apollo is a GraphQL library for the client and server
- Apollo provides an engine for managing your GraphQL gateway (not covered here)
- Apollo client can be used with any UI framework or library
- Apollo server is a Node.js based GraphQL server platform

---
template: content

# .center[Apollo .secondary-color[Client]]
<hr>
- Apollo client works with React, Angular, Vue.js, etc...
- Supports queries, mutations, caching, subscriptions, etc...
- Incrementally adoptable, easily used in existing UI code and works with any GraphQL server

---
template: content

# .center[Apollo .secondary-color[Server]]
<hr>
- Similar to the reference implemention of Express/GraphQL except it works with many Node.js web frameworks including Hapi, Koa, etc...
- GraphQL and the tool GraphIQL can be mounted on different routes
- Http Query Batching
- Apollo Tracing and Cache Control
